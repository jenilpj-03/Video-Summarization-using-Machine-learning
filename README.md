# Video-Summarization-using-Machine-learning

The project aims to revolutionize video summarization using Machine Learning. It seeks to condense lengthy videos into concise 
summaries while retaining essential information. This involves employing deep neural networks for 
tasks like keyframe extraction, scene segmentation, object recognition, and semantic understanding. 
Natural language processing is utilized to generate descriptive textual summaries for better 
accessibility. The approach integrates image processing, captions, and video analysis to create a 
comprehensive solution for quickly summarizing videos and enhancing comprehension.
